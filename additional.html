<h4>The letter from me to me about me</h4>

          This website is mostly for me. To be honest nobody else will probably see it. So I will just gather here information about studying abroad. It's a good way to combine programming with research. Althoug if somehow someone ends up here, he or she will be able to find specific and thorough descriptions of countries and universities, also my career ideas (there won't be much of those tho).
